# Translation Service UI

This is the UI of the translation service. It uses React+Typescript, Vite and Tailwind.

## Initializing the project

Since the package manager used is NPM, you need to run the following commands:

1. install dependencies
```
  npm install
```

2. Initialize project:
```
  npm run dev
```

It will send the requests to the local backend by default (port 8000) as set in the .env file
